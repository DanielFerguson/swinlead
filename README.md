### How to contribute

#### Workflow model

In order to keep the repository as tidy and in-line as possible, please use the [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow model.

#### Sharing work for feedback

If you want to share your work for feedback, you will be able to push the branch to the origin (GitHub). Any time Vercel detects a new branch, it will attempt to deploy it for inspection. This method of sharing work for feedback allows non-technical users to provide it quickly. In order to find your vanity URL (the URL attached to your branch-based deployment), check the Github Actions output.

You can also just share the branch if you are working with other developers.

#### Pull requests

If you are making significant changes, please make a pull request from your `feature/` branch into the `develop` branch and assign another develop to review your work.

If you are unsure of who to assign, please ask one of the community leaders via Discord or Slack.

#### Keep a CHANGELOG

There is a file in this repository called `CHANGELOG.md`. Once you have merged changes from your feature branch, make sure to record your changes in this file in an appropriate format.

If you are unsure of how to format your change messages, please review [this website](https://keepachangelog.com/).
